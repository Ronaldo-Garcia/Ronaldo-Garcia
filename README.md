<h2>üßë‚Äçüíª About Me</h2>

Hi, my name is Ronaldo Garcia!
<br>
<br>
I am a dedicated individual with a profound enthusiasm for information technology, particularly in the realms of network and cloud computing. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Western Governors University, expected to be completed by Summer 2026. My educational journey, coupled with my hands-on projects and certifications, has equipped me with a solid foundation in IT.
<br>
<br>
I have successfully implemented various IT projects, such as setting up a Help Desk Ticketing System using Azure Virtual Machines and deploying Active Directory on-premises in Azure. These experiences have honed my skills in utilizing platforms like Azure, managing virtual machines, and understanding network security concepts.
<br>
<br>
In addition to my technical projects, I bring a wealth of experience from my role as a Warehouse Operations Associate at The Home Depot, where I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and teamwork abilities. My commitment to continuous learning is evident through my certifications, including CompTIA A+, and my ongoing efforts to obtain CompTIA Network+ and Security+.
<br>
<br>
I am passionate about advancing my IT career and am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting. My goal is to contribute effectively to technology-driven initiatives and to stay updated with the latest advancements in the field. I look forward to embracing new challenges and making a significant impact in the ever-evolving world of information technology.
