<h2>üßë‚Äçüíª About Me</h2>

Hi, my name is Ronaldo Garcia!
<br>
<br>
I am a passionate IT professional with a strong focus on Cybersecurity and IT. I‚Äôm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Western Governors University, with an expected graduation in Summer 2026. My studies, combined with practical projects and certifications, have laid a solid groundwork in IT.
<br>
<br>
In my current role as an Desktop Support Technician at the City of Downey, I am actively applying the skills and knowledge I‚Äôve acquired, while continually expanding my expertise through hands-on experiences and certifications. I provide technical support for hardware, software, and network issues, troubleshooting across operating systems and devices to ensure smooth system functionality. I also recommend improvements, maintain a professional rapport with clients, and prioritize tasks independently to deliver effective IT solutions.
<br>
<br>
My background also includes valuable experience as an Operations Associate at The Home Depot, where I strengthened my problem-solving, communication, and teamwork skills. I hold a CompTIA A+ certification and am actively working toward obtaining CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth.
<br>
<br>
I am driven to advance in my IT career, contribute to technology-driven initiatives, and stay on the cutting edge of industry developments. I look forward to taking on new challenges and making a meaningful impact in the dynamic fields of IT and Cybersecurity.
